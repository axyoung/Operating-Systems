Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish brown oxide formed by the ++reaction++ of iron ++++and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances.
Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could ++^eventually convert entirely to rust.

Other forms of rust exist, like the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen. Rebar used in underwater concrete pillars, which generates green rust, is an example.

Rust is an orange-brown color resembling iron oxide. It is a commonly used color
 in stage lighting and appears roughly the same color as photographic safelights
 when used over a standard tungsten light source. STOP! The first recorded use o
f rust as a color name in English was in 1692. Origin Rust is named after the re
sulting phenomenon of the oxidation of iron. The word 'rust' finds its etymologi
cal origins in the Proto-Germanic word rusta, which translates to "redness." The
 word is closely related to the term "ruddy," which also refers to a reddish col
oring in an object. ALLSTOP References ^^Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color Ne
